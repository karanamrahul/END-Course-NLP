This model achives our best perplexity yet, ~27 compared to ~34 for the previous model.\n\n## Introduction\n\nAs a reminder, here is the general encoder-decoder model:\n\n![](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-seq2seq/blob/master/assets/seq2seq1.png?raw=1)\n\nIn the previous model, our architecture was set-up in a way to reduce \"information compression\" by explicitly passing the context vector, $z$, to the decoder at every time-step and by passing both the context vector and embedded input word, $d(y_t)$, along with the hidden state, $s_t$, to the linear layer, $f$, to make a prediction.\n\n![](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-seq2seq/blob/master/assets/seq2seq7.png?raw=1)\n\nEven though we have reduced some of this compression, our context vector still needs to contain all of the information about the source sentence. The model implemented in this notebook avoids this compression by allowing the decoder to look at the entire source sentence (via its hidden states) at each decoding step! How does it do this? It uses *attention*. \n\nAttention works by first, calculating an attention vector, $a$, that is the length of the source sentence. The attention vector has the property that each element is between 0 and 1, and the entire vector sums to 1. We then calculate a weighted sum of our source sentence hidden states, $H$, to get a weighted source vector, $w$. \n\n$$w = \\sum_{i}a_ih_i$$\n\nWe calculate a new weighted source vector every time-step when decoding, using it as input to our decoder RNN as well as the linear layer to make a prediction. We'll explain how to do all of this during the session.\n\n## Preparing Data\n\nAgain, the preparation is similar to last time.\n\nFirst we import all the required modules."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nPATH='../input/ambigqa'","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"rySJ5AJb9ejE","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.optim as optim\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\nfrom torchtext.data import TabularDataset\nfrom torchtext.datasets import Multi30k\nfrom torchtext.data import Field, BucketIterator\n\nimport spacy\nimport numpy as np\n\nimport random\nimport math\nimport time","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"rD1fj0R39ejE"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Set the random seeds for reproducability."},{"metadata":{"id":"uZJrN5ry9ejE","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"SEED = 1234\n\nrandom.seed(SEED)\nnp.random.seed(SEED)\ntorch.manual_seed(SEED)\ntorch.cuda.manual_seed(SEED)\ntorch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"w4Cul6h19ejF"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Load the German and English spaCy models."},{"metadata":{"id":"QmVlgfQY9ejF","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"\nspacy_en = spacy.load('en')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"XSzI_oby9ejF"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We create the tokenizers."},{"metadata":{"id":"y8iY7pVS9ejF","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"\n\ndef tokenize_en(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    Tokenizes English text from a string into a list of strings\n    \"\"\"\n    return [tok.text for tok in spacy_en.tokenizer(text)]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"kB3nEW--9ejF"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The fields remain the same as before."},{"metadata":{"id":"TGkGbyPl9ejF","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"SRC = Field(tokenize = tokenize_en, \n            init_token = '<sos>', \n            eos_token = '<eos>', \n            lower = True)\n\nTRG = Field(tokenize = tokenize_en, \n            init_token = '<sos>', \n            eos_token = '<eos>', \n            lower = True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"l1DXtJYx9ejF"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Load the data."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_csv=pd.read_csv(r'../input/ambigqa/train_data_proc_AmbigQA.csv')\ntest_csv=pd.read_csv(r'../input/ambigqa/test_data_proc_AmbigQA.csv')\nvalid_csv=pd.read_csv(r'../input/ambigqa/valid_data_proc_AmbigQA.csv')\n\nprint(train_csv.head())\nprint(test_csv.head())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"O_jPlIgA9ejF","outputId":"ecd8f27d-9e52-47a1-87dd-aaf45e320d6f","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_data, valid_data,test_data = TabularDataset.splits(\n   path = PATH,\n   train = 'train_data_proc_AmbigQA.csv',\n   validation = 'valid_data_proc_AmbigQA.csv',\n    test='test_data_proc_AmbigQA.csv', \n   format = 'csv',\n   fields =  [('src', SRC), ('trg', TRG)],\n   skip_header = True\n)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"Ot8vlVo09ejF"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Build the vocabulary."},{"metadata":{"id":"HdMSPoGm9ejF","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"SRC.build_vocab(train_data, min_freq = 2)\nTRG.build_vocab(train_data, min_freq = 2)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"BtqKGxNO9ejF"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Define the device."},{"metadata":{"id":"ey8yA-Yh9ejF","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')\nprint(device)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"aqnAGiVU9ejF"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Create the iterators."},{"metadata":{"id":"g50zv9L79ejF","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"BATCH_SIZE = 128\n\ntrain_iterator, valid_iterator,test_iterator = BucketIterator.splits(\n    (train_data, valid_data,test_data), \n    batch_size = BATCH_SIZE,sort_key = lambda x : len(x.src),\n    device = device)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"QP5s8Vov9ejF"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Building the Seq2Seq Model\n\n### Encoder\n\nFirst, we'll build the encoder. Similar to the previous model, we only use a single layer GRU, however we now use a *bidirectional RNN*. With a bidirectional RNN, we have two RNNs in each layer. A *forward RNN* going over the embedded sentence from left to right (shown below in green), and a *backward RNN* going over the embedded sentence from right to left (teal). All we need to do in code is set `bidirectional = True` and then pass the embedded sentence to the RNN as before. \n\n![](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-seq2seq/blob/master/assets/seq2seq8.png?raw=1)\n\nWe now have:\n\n$$\\begin{align*}\nh_t^\\rightarrow &= \\text{EncoderGRU}^\\rightarrow(e(x_t^\\rightarrow),h_{t-1}^\\rightarrow)\\\\\nh_t^\\leftarrow &= \\text{EncoderGRU}^\\leftarrow(e(x_t^\\leftarrow),h_{t-1}^\\leftarrow)\n\\end{align*}$$\n\nWhere $x_0^\\rightarrow = \\text{<sos>}, x_1^\\rightarrow = \\text{guten}$ and $x_0^\\leftarrow = \\text{<eos>}, x_1^\\leftarrow = \\text{morgen}$.\n\nAs before, we only pass an input (`embedded`) to the RNN, which tells PyTorch to initialize both the forward and backward initial hidden states ($h_0^\\rightarrow$ and $h_0^\\leftarrow$, respectively) to a tensor of all zeros. We'll also get two context vectors, one from the forward RNN after it has seen the final word in the sentence, $z^\\rightarrow=h_T^\\rightarrow$, and one from the backward RNN after it has seen the first word in the sentence, $z^\\leftarrow=h_T^\\leftarrow$.\n\nThe RNN returns `outputs` and `hidden`. \n\n`outputs` is of size **[src len, batch size, hid dim * num directions]** where the first `hid_dim` elements in the third axis are the hidden states from the top layer forward RNN, and the last `hid_dim` elements are hidden states from the top layer backward RNN. We can think of the third axis as being the forward and backward hidden states concatenated together other, i.e. $h_1 = [h_1^\\rightarrow; h_{T}^\\leftarrow]$, $h_2 = [h_2^\\rightarrow; h_{T-1}^\\leftarrow]$ and we can denote all encoder hidden states (forward and backwards concatenated together) as $H=\\{ h_1, h_2, ..., h_T\\}$.\n\n`hidden` is of size **[n layers * num directions, batch size, hid dim]**, where **[-2, :, :]** gives the top layer forward RNN hidden state after the final time-step (i.e. after it has seen the last word in the sentence) and **[-1, :, :]** gives the top layer backward RNN hidden state after the final time-step (i.e. after it has seen the first word in the sentence).\n\nAs the decoder is not bidirectional, it only needs a single context vector, $z$, to use as its initial hidden state, $s_0$, and we currently have two, a forward and a backward one ($z^\\rightarrow=h_T^\\rightarrow$ and $z^\\leftarrow=h_T^\\leftarrow$, respectively). We solve this by concatenating the two context vectors together, passing them through a linear layer, $g$, and applying the $\\tanh$ activation function. \n\n$$z=\\tanh(g(h_T^\\rightarrow, h_T^\\leftarrow)) = \\tanh(g(z^\\rightarrow, z^\\leftarrow)) = s_0$$\n\n**Note**: this is actually a deviation from the paper. Instead, they feed only the first backward RNN hidden state through a linear layer to get the context vector/decoder initial hidden state. This doesn't seem to make sense to me, so we have changed it.\n\nAs we want our model to look back over the whole of the source sentence we return `outputs`, the stacked forward and backward hidden states for every token in the source sentence.

This will take in the previous hidden state of the decoder, $s_{t-1}$, and all of the stacked forward and backward hidden states from the encoder, $H$. The layer will output an attention vector, $a_t$, that is the length of the source sentence, each element is between 0 and 1 and the entire vector sums to 1.\n\nIntuitively, this layer takes what we have decoded so far, $s_{t-1}$, and all of what we have encoded, $H$, to produce a vector, $a_t$, that represents which words in the source sentence we should pay the most attention to in order to correctly predict the next word to decode, $\\hat{y}_{t+1}$. \n\nFirst, we calculate the *energy* between the previous decoder hidden state and the encoder hidden states. As our encoder hidden states are a sequence of $T$ tensors, and our previous decoder hidden state is a single tensor, the first thing we do is `repeat` the previous decoder hidden state $T$ times. We then calculate the energy, $E_t$, between them by concatenating them together and passing them through a linear layer (`attn`) and a $\\tanh$ activation function. \n\n$$E_t = \\tanh(\\text{attn}(s_{t-1}, H))$$ \n\nThis can be thought of as calculating how well each encoder hidden state \"matches\" the previous decoder hidden state.\n\nWe currently have a **[dec hid dim, src len]** tensor for each example in the batch. We want this to be **[src len]** for each example in the batch as the attention should be over the length of the source sentence. This is achieved by multiplying the `energy` by a **[1, dec hid dim]** tensor, $v$.\n\n$$\\hat{a}_t = v E_t$$\n\nWe can think of $v$ as the weights for a weighted sum of the energy across all encoder hidden states. These weights tell us how much we should attend to each token in the source sequence. The parameters of $v$ are initialized randomly, but learned with the rest of the model via backpropagation. Note how $v$ is not dependent on time, and the same $v$ is used for each time-step of the decoding. We implement $v$ as a linear layer without a bias.\n\nFinally, we ensure the attention vector fits the constraints of having all elements between 0 and 1 and the vector summing to 1 by passing it through a $\\text{softmax}$ layer.\n\n$$a_t = \\text{softmax}(\\hat{a_t})$$\n\nThis gives us the attention over the source sentence!\n\nGraphically, this looks something like below. This is for calculating the very first attention vector, where $s_{t-1} = s_0 = z$.

We also need to ensure that `hidden` and `encoder_outputs` are passed to the decoder. \n\nBriefly going over all of the steps:\n- the `outputs` tensor is created to hold all predictions, $\\hat{Y}$\n- the source sequence, $X$, is fed into the encoder to receive $z$ and $H$\n- the initial decoder hidden state is set to be the `context` vector, $s_0 = z = h_T$\n- we use a batch of `<sos>` tokens as the first `input`, $y_1$\n- we then decode within a loop:\n  - inserting the input token $y_t$, previous hidden state, $s_{t-1}$, and all encoder outputs, $H$, into the decoder\n  - receiving a prediction, $\\hat{y}_{t+1}$, and a new hidden state, $s_t$\n  - we then decide if we are going to teacher force or not, setting the next input as appropriate"},{"metadata":{"id":"UEkTIixA9ejF","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"class Seq2Seq(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, encoder, decoder, device):\n        super().__init__()\n        \n        self.encoder = encoder\n        self.decoder = decoder\n        self.device = device\n        \n    def forward(self, src, trg, teacher_forcing_ratio = 0.5):\n        \n        #src = [src len, batch size]\n        #trg = [trg len, batch size]\n        #teacher_forcing_ratio is probability to use teacher forcing\n        #e.g. if teacher_forcing_ratio is 0.75 we use teacher forcing 75% of the time\n        \n        batch_size = src.shape[1]\n        trg_len = trg.shape[0]\n        trg_vocab_size = self.decoder.output_dim\n        \n        #tensor to store decoder outputs\n        outputs = torch.zeros(trg_len, batch_size, trg_vocab_size).to(self.device)\n        \n        #encoder_outputs is all hidden states of the input sequence, back and forwards\n        #hidden is the final forward and backward hidden states, passed through a linear layer\n        encoder_outputs, hidden = self.encoder(src)\n                \n        #first input to the decoder is the <sos> tokens\n        input = trg[0,:]\n        \n        for t in range(1, trg_len):\n            \n            #insert input token embedding, previous hidden state and all encoder hidden states\n            #receive output tensor (predictions) and new hidden state\n            output, hidden = self.decoder(input, hidden, encoder_outputs)\n            \n            #place predictions in a tensor holding predictions for each token\n            outputs[t] = output\n            \n            #decide if we are going to use teacher forcing or not\n            teacher_force = random.random() < teacher_forcing_ratio\n            \n            #get the highest predicted token from our predictions\n            top1 = output.argmax(1) \n            \n            #if teacher forcing, use actual next token as next input\n            #if not, use predicted token\n            input = trg[t] if teacher_force else top1\n\n        return outputs","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"cXyLKEkh9ejF"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Training the Seq2Seq Model\n\nThe rest of this session is very similar to the previous one.\n\nWe initialise our parameters, encoder, decoder and seq2seq model (placing it on the GPU if we have one).
